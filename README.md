#### 1. Write a C program and run it in command prompt.

#### 2. Write a C program then create a makefile and run the program using that makefile.

#### 3. Write a C or C++ program that accepts a filename as command line argument and prints the file’s contents on console. If the file does not exist, print some error on the screen.

#### 4. Create a program that creates a child process. The child process prints “I am a child process” 100 times in a loop. Whereas the parent process prints “I am a parent process” 100 times in a loop.

#### 5. Write a program which uses fork ()/CreateProcess system-call to create a child process. The child process prints the contents of the current directory and the parent process waits for the child process to terminate.

#### 6. Calculate the waiting time, turn around time, average waiting time, and average turn around time using the SJF, FCFS, priority scheduling, and Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithms.

| P1      | 5            | 8          |
| P2      | 6            | 10         |
